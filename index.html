	  <p>Write one paragraph explaining your opinion: which hosting platform, (a), (b), or (c), above, do you think is best for keeping information about articles? Why?

	  I think the best hosting platform out of the three for keeping information about articles is (c) 000webhost. I say this because it comes with multiple templates to make your index.html, has links to teach you to code, and it makes for a more appealing article if you use its templates.</p
